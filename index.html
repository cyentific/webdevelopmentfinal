          <h1 class="pvc">Pros Vs. Cons</h1>
          <h2 class="headered">Pros</h2>
          <h3 class="pro">Expanding Knowledge</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            With an innumerable population, social media allows
            users to connect and share knowledge across a variety of countries,
            cultures, and subjects. Users are easily able to find information
            about their interests and can verify that information through a
            variety of sources.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Finding Community</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            With most people having access to the internet, and thus social
            media, users are able to connect with others and form communities
            with shared interests that can range from religion, gaming
            preferences, identity, to virtually anything. Through community,
            people are able to feel less alone.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Source of Inspiration</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            Social media can be an incredibly powerful tool to gather
            references and relevant sources of inspiration for potential work.
            With the help of intelligent algorithms, all apps recommend users
            content based on the user’s interest. This makes the sorting of
            content more efficient for users, as well as allowing users to find
            relevant content that they might not have seen otherwise.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Promoting your work</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            Social media acts most importantly as a platform for commerce,
            marketing, and connections. Creative users are able to share their
            work on platforms like Instagram to present their portfolio and
            find their audiences. With exposure, creatives can be able to find
            clients for their services or products.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Getting Feedback</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            With a public profile, creative users are able to post their
            content publicly, allowing virtually anybody to respond. This can
            be beneficial as it can allow the user to gain constructive
            criticism to improve their work, however this can also work
            negatively to allow people to comment hate. It is incredibly
            important for the user to monitor the activity of their account,
            in order to ensure that they are not a victim of hate.</p>

          <h2 class="headered">Cons</h2>
          <h3 class="pro">Oversaturation</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            Due to the large volume of users and hence content per user, there
            is a lot of diversity in both the quality and content of work that
            is uploaded on social media. As a result, while algorithms can help
            users find desired content, users still have to spend time sorting
            through the options presented to them to find desired references.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pro">Quantification of Creativity</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            Because social media is innately built on the frameworks of likes,
            shares, and comments. Creatives often have to deal with and accept
            the quantification of their work. It can easily become a comparison
            game with others as each post has publicly available data that
            represents the work.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Theft of Ideas</h3>
          <p class="texted">
            As it was mentioned, social media can serve as a great resource for
            finding references however this comes at the cost that a user’s
            posts and content can easily become another person’s reference.
            With this risk comes the possibility of a creative user’s design
            or content being copied by an external party. This evidently raises
            concerns about intellectual property, but this is a risk that
            user’s need to evaluate before sharing non-copyrighted,
            non-patented, or unprotected work.</p>
         <h3 class="pro">Losing Sense of Real Life</h3>
         <p class="texted">
              While social media can allow individuals to connect with other
              individuals across the world, this can easily take away time for
              users to interact with people in real life. As a result there is
              a loss in real life connection.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Time waste</h3>
          <p class="texted">
              Apps are designed to manipulate users into addiction through
              predictive algorithms and attention psychology. This can cause
              users to waste a lot of time.</p>
          <h3 class="pro">Online Hate</h3>
          <p class="texted">
              With such a diverse audience and reach, social media allows users
              from all sorts of interests to interact. If anything apps try to
              mingle users from opposing views to create tension and virality.
              As a result, social media can quickly foster toxic and harmful
              online environments, like online hate, death threats, and more.
