        <h3 class="pro">Expanding Knowledge</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          With an innumerable population, social media allows
          users to connect and share knowledge across a variety of countries,
          cultures, and subjects. Users are easily able to find information
          about their interests and can verify that information through a
          variety of sources.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="pro">Finding Community</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          With most people having access to the internet, and thus social
          media, users are able to connect with others and form communities
          with shared interests that can range from religion, gaming
          preferences, identity, to virtually anything. Through community,
          people are able to feel less alone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="pro">Source of Inspiration</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          Social media can be an incredibly powerful tool to gather
          references and relevant sources of inspiration for potential work.
          With the help of intelligent algorithms, all apps recommend users
          content based on the user’s interest. This makes the sorting of
          content more efficient for users, as well as allowing users to find
          relevant content that they might not have seen otherwise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="pro">Promoting your work</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          Social media acts most importantly as a platform for commerce,
          marketing, and connections. Creative users are able to share their
          work on platforms like Instagram to present their portfolio and
          find their audiences. With exposure, creatives can be able to find
          clients for their services or products.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="pro">Getting Feedback</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          With a public profile, creative users are able to post their
          content publicly, allowing virtually anybody to respond. This can
          be beneficial as it can allow the user to gain constructive
          criticism to improve their work, however this can also work
          negatively to allow people to comment hate. It is incredibly
          important for the user to monitor the activity of their account,
          in order to ensure that they are not a victim of hate.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headered">Cons</h2>
        <div class="columnContainer">
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="con">Oversaturation</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          Due to the large volume of users and hence content per user, there
          is a lot of diversity in both the quality and content of work that
          is uploaded on social media. As a result, while algorithms can help
          users find desired content, users still have to spend time sorting
          through the options presented to them to find desired references.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="con">Quantification of Creativity</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          Because social media is innately built on the frameworks of likes,
          shares, and comments. Creatives often have to deal with and accept
          the quantification of their work. It can easily become a comparison
          game with others as each post has publicly available data that
          represents the work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="con">Theft of Ideas</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          As it was mentioned, social media can serve as a great resource for
          finding references however this comes at the cost that a user’s
          posts and content can easily become another person’s reference.
          With this risk comes the possibility of a creative user’s design
          or content being copied by an external party. This evidently raises
          concerns about intellectual property, but this is a risk that
          user’s need to evaluate before sharing non-copyrighted,
          non-patented, or unprotected work.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="con">Losing Sense of Real Life</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          While social media can allow individuals to connect with other
          individuals across the world, this can easily take away time for
          users to interact with people in real life. As a result there is
          a loss in real life connection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="con">Time waste</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          Apps are designed to manipulate users into addiction through
          predictive algorithms and attention psychology. This can cause
          users to waste a lot of time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="itemz">
        <h3 class="con">Online Hate</h3>
        <p class="texted">
          With such a diverse audience and reach, social media allows users
          from all sorts of interests to interact. If anything apps try to
          mingle users from opposing views to create tension and virality.
          As a result, social media can quickly foster toxic and harmful
          online environments, like online hate, death threats, and more.
